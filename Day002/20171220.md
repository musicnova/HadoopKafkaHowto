Start the Ambari Server
Run the following command on the Ambari Server host:


`
ambari-server start
`


To check the Ambari Server processes:

`
ambari-server status
`


To stop the Ambari Server:

`
ambari-server stop
`


[Note]	Note
If you plan to use an existing database instance for Hive or for Oozie, you must prepare to use a non-default database before installing your Hadoop cluster.

On Ambari Server start, Ambari runs a database consistency check looking for issues. If any issues are found, Ambari Server start will abort and display the following message: DB configs consistency check failed. Ambari writes more details about database consistency check results to the/var/log/ambari-server/ambari-server-check-database.log file.

You can force Ambari Server to start by skipping this check with the following option:

ambari-server start --skip-database-check
If you have database issues, by choosing to skip this check, do not make any changes to your cluster topology or perform a cluster upgrade until you correct the database consistency issues. Please contact Hortonworks Support and provide the ambari-server-check-database.log output for assistance.

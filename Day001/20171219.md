Log in to your host as root.

Download the Ambari repository file to a directory on your installation host.


`
wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ambari.list http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/ambari/ubuntu16/2.x/updates/2.6.0.0/ambari.list
`


`
apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com B9733A7A07513CAD
`


`
apt-get update
`


[Important]	Important
Do not modify the ambari.list file name. This file is expected to be available on the Ambari Server host during Agent registration.

Confirm that Ambari packages downloaded successfully by checking the package name list.


`
apt-cache showpkg ambari-server
`


`
apt-cache showpkg ambari-agent
`


`
apt-cache showpkg ambari-metrics-assembly
`



You should see the Ambari packages in the list.

[Note]	Note
When deploying a cluster having limited or no Internet access, you should provide access to the bits using an alternative method.

Ambari Server by default uses an embedded PostgreSQL database. When you install the Ambari Server, the PostgreSQL packages and dependencies must be available for install. These packages are typically available as part of your Operating System repositories. Please confirm you have the appropriate repositories available for the postgresql-server packages.

This has to do with Avahi, a Zeroconf implementation which advertises hostnames on the local network.

You can get started with Avahi on your server by installing the daemon:


`
sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
`


From that point, you should be ready to go. Check out the docs in /usr/share/doc/avahi-daemon/ if you have additional trouble.
